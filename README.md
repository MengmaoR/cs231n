# cs231n
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the course [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/).
I'm not a Stanford student, so this answers wont be submitted or graded, therefore I can't promise the correctness of the answers.
However, I'll try my best, and willing for discussions.
